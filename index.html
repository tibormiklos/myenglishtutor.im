        <p class="intro">I provide one-to-one English literature and language tuition from my home in Laxey to pupils
          across the Island. I teach adult learners, GCSE students and primary pupils. My hours are flexible – get in
          touch to find a slot that suits you.</p>

          <p class="p-head">The Teaching</p>
          <p>I provide exam-specific guidance and practise; I also help with basic skills: sentence structure,
            punctuation and reading comprehension.</p>
          <p>I like to tailor my lessons to the interests of my pupils, and I encourage my pupils, as they progress, to
            become increasingly involved in the planning – this way they learn to take ownership of the process.</p>

        <div class="two-col">
          <p class="p-head">Supporting Parents</p>
          <p>It can be frustrating to feel that you are cut off from what your child is learning at school.</p>
          <p>I am always available to talk personally to you about your child’s progress and provide you with support
            and materials if you would like to augment their learning at home.</p>

      <div class="tuition-pricing contained">
          <p class="p-head">Pricing and payment</p>
          <p>I charge £30 per hour with no extra charges for materials or meetings. You can pay monthly or termly in advance by cheque or bank transfer. We’ll start with a free, no-commitment initial consultation to find out how I can help you and your child.</p>

          <h1 class="h2">About me</h1>
          <p>I am an English graduate of Edinburgh University with a PGCE from Brunel. I have been providing private tuition to pupils from Year 5 to Year 11 for over 5 years.</p>
          <p>What I love about this work is that it gives me the opportunity to watch my pupils grow in confidence and ability over the years.</p>
          <p>There is nothing more satisfying than the expression on someone’s face when they produce a piece of work that they are proud of – or when they overcome an obstacle that they thought they would never conquer.</p>
          <p>This is why I do it. </p>
